\section{Introduction}
In \citeyear{BA_Pendry_1983}, \citeauthor{BA_Pendry_1983} derived a bound on the flow of information, which reads
\begin{align}\label{eq:pendry}
    \dot{I}^2 \leq \frac{\pi}{3\hbar\ln^22}\dot{E}.
\end{align}
This result is derived using classical statistical mechanics \cite{BA_Pendry_1983}. This classical framework, however,
neglects the effects of genuine quantum mechanical phenomena, such as quantum correlations. We show that this
classical inequality is violated when in a system with quantum correlations.
\section{The model}
Consider a chain of qubits in the Heisenberg-$XY$ model. Restricting their interaction to their nearest neighbors allows
us to draw a comparison to Pendry's original derivation with fermions using Jordan-Wigner transform, mapping a chain of
spin-$1/2$ qubits to a chain of spinless fermions. The information flow is then the time derivative of 

In particular, we have the Hamiltonian of this system as
\begin{align}\label{eq:hamiltonian-perfect-transfer}
    H &= \sum\limits_i \sigma^z_i + \sum\limits_k \frac{J_k}{2} (\sigma^x_k\sigma^x_{k+1}+\sigma^y_k\sigma^y_{k+1})\\
    \shortintertext{with}\\
    J_k &= \frac{\lambda}{2}\sqrt{k\cdot(N-k)}.\nonumber
\end{align}
This ensures a predictable periodic behaviour of the chain. This can be made apparent by considering the local
magnetization $\expval{\sigma^z_k}$ of the qubits. \Cref{fig:no-corr} shows the time evolution of the quibts'
magnetization.\footnote{We choose $\lambda$ to be $1$. It was shown in \cite{BA_Christandl_2004} that at
time $t=\pi/\lambda$, perfect state transfer is achieved}

    Hamiltonian defined as in \cref{eq:hamiltonian-perfect-transfer}.
    Qubit $i=1$ is prepared in the excited state at time $t=0$.
    Qubits $i>1$ are prepared in the ground state at time $t=0$.}

\end{figure}
\section{Quantum correlations}
In a work by \citeauthor{BA_kaonan_correlations}, it was shown that certain quantum correlations
\emph{invert} the flow of energy \cite{BA_kaonan_correlations}. Heat flows not from hot to cold, but
from cold to hot. \Cref{fig:corr} shows the chain with initial correlations at positions 1 and 2 of the chain.

    \caption{Time Evolution of the individual magnetizations of the qubits
    $\expval{\sigma^z_i}$, where the interaction is governed by \cref{eq:hamiltonian-perfect-transfer}.
    Qubits $i=1$ and $i=2$ are prepared in an initially correlated state $\rho_{12} = \rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 + \chi$
    and qubits $i\neq1,2$ are prepared in the ground state.
    Locally, Qubit $1$ and $2$ are in a thermal state each, with identical inverse temperature $\beta = 1/300$.}

%Since energy is conserved the flow into this segment equals the
%flow out and therefore energy flow is conserved as is the particle flow. However,
%the entropy flow is not conserved but can only increase monotonically until thermal
%equilibrium is established.
